		<p> Cats are small animals when compared to humans. They have fur for protection against cold weather.
		They also have claws, which can scratch objects. These claws make cats very difficult opponents to fight. They
		also have a strong, flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth, and &#8220;retractable&#8221; claws, meaning 
		they can be drawn back into the toe in a special sheath.

		great way to give them that. They are also well known to drink milk. They also prey on rats &#38; fish, and the 
		former could help you get rid of rats in your house.</p>
